    <section id="The Cradle of Civilization">
        <h2>The Cradle of Civilization</h2>
        <p>the lifeblood of Egypt. Around 3100 BC, Upper and Lower Egypt united under a single ruler, Menes, marking the dawn of a unified Egyptian civilization. This period, known as the Old Kingdom, is famous for its monumental pyramids, like the iconic Giza complex, built as tombs for Pharaohs â€“  powerful rulers believed to be divine.</p>

    <section id="The Middle Kingdom and The New Kingdom">
        <h2>The Middle Kingdom and The New Kingdom</h2>
        <p>After a period of instability, Egypt rebounds in the Middle Kingdom, focusing on trade, agriculture, and powerful pharaohs who restored order. The New Kingdom ushers in an era of vast empires. Pharaohs like Thutmose I and Ramses II stretch Egyptian influence into Nubia and the Levant. This is a golden age of art, architecture, and innovation.</p>

    <section id="The End of an Era and New Beginnings">
        <h2>The End of an Era and New Beginnings</h2>
        <p>Despite its glory, Egypt faces challenges. Invasions and internal struggles lead to a decline in power. Yet, Egypt's spirit endures. The Ptolemaic Kingdom, founded by Alexander the Great's successor, blends Greek and Egyptian cultures. Then comes the Roman conquest, which absorbs Egypt into its vast empire.</p>

        <h2>The Rise of Islam and Modern Egypt</h2>
        <p>Christianity flourishes for centuries, but Islam arrives in the 7th century AD, shaping Egyptian culture profoundly. Egypt becomes part of various Islamic empires, then a Khedivate under Ottoman control. In the 19th century, Muhammad Ali modernizes Egypt, and British influence grows. The 20th century is marked by revolution, independence, and the rise of Pan-Arabism under Gamal Abdel Nasser.</p>
